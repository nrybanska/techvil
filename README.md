<h1>Techvil Documentation</h1>

<h2>Executing the App</h2>
<p>Download the <code>Techvil.zip</code> file and open it in a code editor. Then, execute the <code>TechvilGame.java</code>. The game is now ready to play.</p>

<h2>About Techvil</h2>
<p>Techvil is a technological company where the player is employed. By completing progressively more difficult challenges, the player advances in their career at Techvil. Along the way, they uncover the company’s deepest secrets. Are you ready to become the new Techvil CEO?</p>

<h2>Topics of Choice</h2>

<h3>1. User Experience (UX)</h3>

<h4>a) Intuitive Design</h4>
<p>Techvil does not contain specific instructions on how to play, but it’s designed to guide players intuitively through each stage. The graphics are intentionally minimal and plot-appropriate, ensuring they support rather than distract from gameplay and are not overwhelming. This keeps the focus on player progress and reduces potential confusion. Each functional element is designed to be both accessible and aesthetically appealing, enhancing the experience while keeping interactions straightforward.</p>

<h4>b) Target Audience</h4>
<p>The primary target audience for our game is Computer Science students. To engage this group, we chose a corporate tech environment that reflects career paths they are likely to pursue. This setting promotes immersion and interest. We also incorporated popular meme sound effects that align with the game’s theme to enhance engagement and evoke emotional responses. For added tension, a timer sound during challenges creates a stressful atmosphere. Upon completion or failure of each level, players receive sound cues—either congratulatory or mocking—supporting the storyline connection and resonating with a young audience.</p>

<h4>c) Inclusivity</h4>
<p>To ensure Techvil is accessible to a diverse audience, the game’s design incorporates high-contrast visuals that improve readability for players with reading difficulties or visual impairments. The game is inclusive regarding accessibility, accommodating potential users' physical limitations, such as difficulties with reading small text or dependency on sound effects.</p>

<h3>2. Version Control</h3>
<p>Our exploration of Git and GitHub aimed to deepen our understanding of version control concepts and their practical applications in software development. Initially, we familiarized ourselves with essential Git commands, such as <code>git init</code>, <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, and <code>git push</code> to upload code to GitHub. Although we faced early challenges with version consistency, we quickly resolved these and became adept at managing version control collaboratively.</p>

<p>For our research, we primarily referenced the book "Pro Git" by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, along with GitHub’s official resources on version control. These resources covered a wide range of content. "Pro Git" helped us understand branching, a valuable tool for project organization, while GitHub’s version control guide offered practical insights into repository management.</p>

<p>The greatest assistance we received from these resources was in handling merge conflicts. Initially, we struggled and made errors by simply deleting conflict markers, which led to further issues. Consulting these sources enabled us to approach and resolve conflicts effectively, without requiring additional cleanup post-merge.</p>

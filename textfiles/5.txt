<h2 >Nearly There!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Employee, impressive work, you’re almost at the top! 
At this point, you must be seeing the full picture. Yes, we’ve taken liberties with labor practices, 
and yes, some might even call it exploitation. But remember, at Techvil, "Innovation at Any Cost" drives everything we do. 
The weak fall behind, but those who understand the true nature of success will thrive.

<p>Doubt is a sign of weakness. Focus on what you’re gaining, not what others are losing.</p>

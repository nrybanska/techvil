<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear employee, another level complete. With it comes more responsibility. 
By now, you’ve likely seen glimpses of how we really operate. 
We trust you to understand that the end always justifies the means. 
Whether it’s cutting corners or bending ethics, it’s all for the greater good of progress.

<p>Not everyone has the strength to push forward without doubt, but you do.</p>
